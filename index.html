        <h2>The Shining</h2>
        <p class="span6">
          Jack Torrance's new job at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect chance for
		  a fresh start. As the off-season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel,
		  he'll have plenty of time to spend reconnecting with his family and working
		  on his writing. But as the harsh winter weather sets in, the idyllic location
		  feels ever more remote...and more sinister. And the only one to notice the 
		  strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, 
		  a uniquely gifted five-year-old.

         Â©1977 Stephen King;

        <h2>Dracula </h2>
        <p class="span6">
          A rich selection of background and source materials is provided in three areas:
		  Contexts includes probable inspirations for Dracula in the earlier works of James
		  Malcolm Rymer and Emily Gerard. Also included are a discussion of Stoker's working
		  notes for the novel and "Dracula's Guest," the original opening chapter to Dracula.
		  Reviews and Reactions reprints five early reviews of the novel. "Dramatic and Film
		  Variations" focuses on theater and film adaptations of Dracula, two indications of 
		  the novel's unwavering appeal. David J. Skal, Gregory A. Waller, and Nina Auerbach
		  offer their varied perspectives. Checklists of both dramatic and film adaptations 
		  are included.

         Criticism collects seven theoretical interpretations of Dracula by Phyllis A. Roth, 
		 Carol A. Senf, Franco Moretti, Christopher Craft, Bram Dijsktra, Stephen D. Arata, 
		 and Talia Schaffer.
